<a href = "http://papers.nber.org/tmp/97077-w22207.pdf" target = "_blank">The Long-Term Consequences Of Teacher Discretion In Grading Of High-Stakes Tests</a>, by Rebecca Diamond and Petra Persson

This is a fascinating study and a good reminder that grade are more signals within the education system and less objective measures of skill or knowledge. The authors identified incidents where Swedish teachers manipulation grades nationwide standardized tests and then tracked students outcomes. Turns out, the students that benefited from grade inflation on a single test were more likely to graduate, had lower rates of teen pregnancy and had higher incomes when they moved on to the job market.

Immensely useful summary of the last ~40 years of research on visual perception and data visualization.

This has been on the shelf for a while, but I finally got around to reading it in earnest. In addition to be any an underrated President, Grant is a great writer: 

>The Southern rebellion was largely the outgrowth of the Mexican war. Nations, like individuals, are punished for their transgressions. We got our punishment in the most sanguinary and expensive war of modern times.
