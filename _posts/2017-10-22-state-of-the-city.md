I'm building a corpus of State of the City speeches from around the United States. My short-term goal is to collect three years of speeches for America's ten biggest cities. The github repo is [here](https://github.com/etachov/state_of_the_city) and a Google Sheet tracking my progress is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSFkKQ-GODmmdvtESCXB1vRz-bXnqfxcJZk6KWgLueV40BEkVtNvYKLtoFE63Iju4JXpnqYFwy6YXgq/pubhtml). 

If you're interested in speechwriting, comparative local politics, or quantitative text analysis feel free to contribute, edit, or analyze. 

One small finding from today: generally the number of lines in a speech correlate with the number of words in a speech. This isn't very surprising. But there are a few speeches that buck this trend. Specifically the [2017 New York City](https://medium.com/@nycgov/this-is-your-city-6230765d11c) speech, which was written in a big-paragraph style, and the [2015](https://www.sandiego.gov/mayor/news/releases/20150114_SOTC), [2016](https://www.sandiego.gov/mayor/news/releases/20160114_StateoftheCityAddress), and [2017](https://www.sandiego.gov/mayor/news/releases/mayor-kevin-l-faulconers-2017-state-city-address-prepared-remarks) San Diego speeches, which are written in bite-size lines.
