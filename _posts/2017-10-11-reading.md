*Gapminder 1*


**[The Absurdly Underestimated Dangers of CSV Injection](http://georgemauer.net/2017/10/07/csv-injection.html)**
by George Mauer

- This attack exploits trust in csv files and quirks in how Excel and Google Sheets execute formulas.
- Any system taken for granted is dangerous. 

**[Research and Development Spending to Bring a Single Cancer Drug to Market and Revenues After Approval](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2653012)**

- Small, hard-to-get data are important data.

**[Is AI Riding a One-Trick Pony](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608911/is-ai-riding-a-one-trick-pony/)**

>"Neural nets are just thoughtless fuzzy pattern recognizers, and as useful as fuzzy pattern recognizers can be—hence the rush to integrate them into just about every kind of software—they represent, at best, a limited brand of intelligence, one that is easily fooled."

**Tools that are making my life easier this week:**
- [Tidygraph](http://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/Introducing-tidygraph/): A tidy approach to network data that makes calculating graph metrics in pipes extremely easy. I used it for [this project](https://github.com/etachov/funder_network) on art funder networks in New York.
- [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify): I used this handy Markov generator to create simulated sentence at different readability levels from a corpus of grant purpose statements. This allowed me to show realistic examples low readability statements without naming and shaming a specific team.


**Make Gapminder 1**
```R

library(tidyverse)
library(ggridges)
library(gapminder)

ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = tan(year), y = continent)) +
  geom_density_ridges(color = "white", alpha = 0) +
  coord_polar() +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "black"))

```
