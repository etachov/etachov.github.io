**[The Absurdly Underestimated Dangers of CSV Injection](http://georgemauer.net/2017/10/07/csv-injection.html)**
by George Mauer

- This attack exploits trust in csv files and quirks in how Excel and Google Sheets execute formulas.
- Any system taken for granted is dangerous. 

**[Is AI Riding a One-Trick Pony?](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608911/is-ai-riding-a-one-trick-pony/)** by James Somers

>"Neural nets are just thoughtless fuzzy pattern recognizers, and as useful as fuzzy pattern recognizers can be—hence the rush to integrate them into just about every kind of software—they represent, at best, a limited brand of intelligence, one that is easily fooled."

**Tools that are making my life easier this week:**
- [Tidygraph](http://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/Introducing-tidygraph/): This tidy approach to network data that makes calculating graph metrics in pipes extremely easy. I used it for [this project](https://github.com/etachov/funder_network) on art funder networks in New York.
- [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify): I used this handy Markov generator to simulated text at different readability levels from a corpus of grant purpose statements. This allowed me to show realistic examples low readability statements without calling out a specific author.


```R
## make gapminder1

library(tidyverse)
library(ggridges)
library(gapminder)

ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = tan(year), y = continent)) +
  geom_density_ridges(color = "white", alpha = 0) +
  coord_polar() +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "black"))

```
