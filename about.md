Hi my name is Evan Tachovsky and I am a researcher interested in how international development and human rights organizations can use data science to manage projects, mitigate risk, and assess impact.

In practice this means I spend a lot of time developing research questions, building tidy datasets from in some of the most bizarre raw data you can imagine, and designing visualizations to communicate complex findings to diverse audiences. 

To do this, I use a lot of R (<a href = "http://adolfoalvarez.cl/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-hadleyverse/" target = "_blank">#hadleyverse</a>), a bit of Python, and sprinkling of D3. I also really like to make maps, mostly with tools from the <a href = "https://www.mapbox.com/products/" target = "_blank">Mapbox stack</a>.

In New York? Let's get a drink some time and talk about what you do and why you do it. Email: etachov@gmail.com
