Hi my name is Evan. Iâ€™m the Global Director of the <a href = "https://www.wri.org/data" target = "_blank">World Resources Institute's Data Lab</a>. I lead the product, engineering, and data teams that power WRI's data products. Views expressed here are fully my own.

Prior to joining WRI, I served as Director of Innovation and Lead Data Scientist at the Rockefeller Foundation. And before that I led research and analytics at Media Development Investment Fund, managed media and technology programs for IREX across the Middle East, and was a Fulbright Fellow in Azerbaijan. I'm a data scientist and cartographer by training with a master's in quantitative methods from Columbia University and bachelor's in political science and psychology from Hiram College.
