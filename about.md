Hi my name is Evan and I'm the lead data scientist and a director at <a href = "https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/" target = "_blank">The Rockefeller Foundation</a>. Views expressed here are fully my own.

At Rockefeller, I design, build, and fund data and technology initiatives. Right now, I'm focused on using data to help stop the spread of Covid-19 and building analytical tools to improve the efficacy of international development.

Recent intiatives I've designed and helped launch include: 
- <a href = "https://lacunafund.org/" target = "_blank">Lacuna Fund</a>. A fund to help researchers and engineers build equitable datasets for machine learning.
- <a href = "https://nursing.jhu.edu/cma" target = "_blank">Covid-19 Modeling Accelerator</a>. A mechanism to quickly translate quantiative new methods into to decision-support tools for policy makers.
- <a href = "https://www.data.org/" target = "_blank">data.org</a>. A global platform for co-funding data science for social impact projects.
- <a href = "https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/center-for-applied-artificial-intelligence/research/cmla" target = "_blank">Computational Medicine Legal Accelerator</a>. An initiative to improve legal frameworks for data sharing.

Outside of Rockefeller, I love to make maps and recently published <a href = "https://beltpublishing.com/products/cleveland-in-50-maps" target = "_blank">Cleveland in 50 Maps</a> with Belt Publishing. If you like maps, cities, the Rust Belt, or any combiniation of those things <a href = "https://beltpublishing.com/products/cleveland-in-50-maps" target = "_blank">check it out</a>.
