Hi my name is Evan Tachovsky and I work on data at <a href = "https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/" target = "_blank">The Rockefeller Foundation</a>. Views expressed here are fully my own.

Right now I'm working on four personal projects: 

* Collecting and analyzing a <a href = "https://github.com/etachov/state_of_the_city" target = "_blank">corpus of State of the City speeches</a> from U.S. cities.
* Understanding the longitudinal effects of algorithms in society, <a href = "http://beltmag.com/the-legacy-of-redlining-in-rust-belt-cities/" target = "_blank">for example</a>.
* Exploring how social sector organizations understand and interact with new technology.
* Researching how folk metrics--rules of thumb used to understand complex systems--evolve and influence communication online, <a href = "https://etachov.shinyapps.io/Twitter_Tern/" target = "_blank">for example</a>.
