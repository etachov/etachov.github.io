Hi my name is Evan and I'm the lead data scientist and a director at <a href = "https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/" target = "_blank">The Rockefeller Foundation</a>. Views expressed here are fully my own.

At Rockefeller, I do and fund data science to help those in need. Practically, this means I help launch new products like <a href = "https://www.atlasai.co/" target = "_blank">Atlas AI</a>, advise our <a href = "https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/our-work/initiatives/e-guide/" target = "_blank"> program teams and partners</a>, and do analysis and visualization to support the Foundation's work.

Outside of Rockefeller, I'm working on a book of cartography titled <a href = "https://beltpublishing.com/products/cleveland-in-50-maps" target = "_blank">Cleveland in 50 Maps</a> for Belt Publishing. If you like maps, cities, the Rust Belt, or any combiniation of those things <a href = "https://beltpublishing.com/products/cleveland-in-50-maps" target = "_blank">pre-order now</a>
