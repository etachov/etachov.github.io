Dear Ashley, 

While this passed year has been a lot of running in circles work and life-wise, I am always happy to be running the circles with you.

I have complete faith that this coming year will be a very good one for bear and can't wait to be there with you. I am also excited to celebrate this weekend and have two more presents for bear when you're here...

Love, 

Evan
